        <p>
            Imagine being on vacation, near the beach, with a group of friends enjoying the sun diving into the sea. 
            In your hand, you hold a beer to accompany this sunset. What kind of beer is it? There is a high chance 
            that your answer is: ‘a light blonde refreshing beer obviously!’. Summer makes us crave a lighter blond beer,  
            while winter is a season for brown beers, high on alcohol to warm us up. 
            But … is everyone thinking like you do ? What do people all over the world think ?  Is it a stereotype? 
            Is this idea verifiable via statistics? That is what we want to explore in our analysis.<br>
            
            Many websites exist where people can give their opinion on the beer they tasted : 
            RateBeer and BeerAdvocate are two of the main popular ones. 
            Analyzing the evolution of parameters such as the given grade or the number of ratings could offer 
            valuable insights into the seasonal trends of various beer styles. 
            Which website should be considered? Let’s examine the country distribution of the two websites:

    <div class="intro-end">
        <p>
            BeerAdvocate seems to be very popular in the US, while the distribution of countries in RateBeer is wider. 
            Pursuing the RateBeer data, let's try to identify seasonal trends!
        </p>

    <div class="paragraph-1">
        <h2 class="paragraph-1-title">Which characteristics display seasonal trends?</h2>
        <p>
            RateBeer dataset offers insights on the beer ratings of the website between 2000 and 2016.
            Among the most rated beer styles on RateBeer, 
            we retrieve 3 beer styles that catches our attention and might be interesting to explore:
            <ul>
                <li>IPA: the most rated beer style on the website</li>
                <li>Pilsener: among the 20 most rated beer styles, known to be fresh blond light beers</li>
                <li>Belgian Strong Ale: among the 20 most rated beer styles, known to be dark strong beers</li>
            </ul> 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph-1">
        <p>
            Considering these three characters: 'The Famous, the Cool, and the Strong,' one would particularly 
            anticipate observing summer trends for Pilsener and winter trends for Belgian Strong Ale.
            What could show that these beer styles are seasonal or not? 

            The RateBeer dataset notably provides the ratings given by the users. The user provides an overall grade 
            for the tasted beer, but also a grade for the aroma, palate, taste, appearance of the beer, and the mean of 
            all these grades gives the rating. These 6 characteristics can be grouped together and considered as ‘user specific’. 
            It can be supposed that a beer receives different ratings depending on when it is consumed—whether in winter or summer.:

                Trends from the evolution of criteria over time are not evident for any of the three beer styles.
                What about the STL plot ?

            Unfortunately, the residuals show the same amplitude as the ‘seasonal’ part of the plots, for each of
            the characteristics and each of the beer styles. Well, the users do not feel a beer differently depending
            on the season. Should we give up? Not yet.<br><br><br>

            <strong>Normalised number of ratings</strong>
            <br><br>
            Indeed, we could think that Pilsener gets <strong>more ratings </strong> during the summer and Belgian Strong Ale during the winter.
            If we infer that people rate at the same period when they drink the beer, variation in the <strong>number of ratings</strong> could be
            representative of variation in beer consumption.<br>
            In order not to be influenced by the global evolution of ratings on the website, let’s consider the normalized number of
            ratings for our 3 beer styles:

        <p>
            Wow! We nicely see trends! According to our inference that rating means consumptions,
            Pilsener seems to be more consumed during the summer while Belgian Strong ale is preferred during the winter!
            We can then question the reason for these particular seasonalities. 
        </p>

    <div class="paragraph-1">
        <h2 class="paragraph-1-title">Which caracteristic explains beer seasonality?</h2>
        <h3 class="paragraph-small-title">Alcohol degree (ABV)</h3>
        <p>
            Maybe these different beer styles have different
            alcohol degrees. The alcohol degree is a quantifiable value, defined as Alcohol By Volume (ABV)

    <div class="paragraph-1">
        <p>
            Pilsener, with clear trends in summer are the lighter beers, while Belgian Strong Ale, showing peaks in winter,
            are stronger. IPA’s alcohol degrees are in the middle, consistent with the more spread and less brutal trend.<br>
            Are lighter beers more drinked in the summer, and inversely for winter beers?
            Let’s split our whole dataset into two categories: light beers and strong beers, and see if the number of ratings
            is periodic and thus depends on the season. But wait. What is considered, as a light or strong beer? We should look
            at the distribution of alcohol degree among our beers to choose:

    <div class="paragraph-1">
        <p>
            With this information, we can define create our 2 new characters:

            <ul>
                <li>Light beers: all the beers whose ABV is strictly inferior to 5</li>
                <li>Strong beers: all the beers whose ABV is superior to 8</li>

    <div class="paragraph-1">
        <p>
            As before, we want to observe the evolution of the normalized number of ratings to see if we have seasonal trends.
            We also need to assess if there is a statistical difference between the normalized number of ratings in the summer
            and in the winter for both beer categories:

    <div class="paragraph-1">
        <p>
            As expected, there is a clear tendency for light beers during the summer and strong beers during the winter.
            Moreover, the difference of normalized number of ratings is statistically significant!<br>
            However, is it the only characteristic that determines our choice of beer during a season? Imagine.
            We are in December and we enter a bar to order a beer. We are cold, tired of the semester and want the best beer
            to feel comfortable. Not sure that the only thing that will influence us for the choice of the beer is the alcohol 
            degree. For example, we could be more appealed by a brown, dark beer than by a pale one! Or maybe we will favor a 
            bitter beer compared to a sweet mild one!
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph-1">
        <h3 class="paragraph-small-title">Color (SRM) and Bitterness (IBU)</h3>
        <p>
            Well, let’s see if beers with different colors or bitterness are drunk at different seasons: <br>
            - The most common value used (in the US at least) to measure beer’s color is the Standard Reference Method,
            or SRM scale for short. Globally, a low SRM value corresponds to a pale beer, while a high SRM value corresponds
            to dark beers.<br>
            - To measure bitterness, the International Bitterness Unit (IBU) is widely accepted as the standard. Mild beers typically 
            have a low IBU, while, conversely, bitter beers tend to have a higher IBU.<br><br>

            Unfortunately, these characteristics are not given by the website.

            We chose to take an alternative method: we gave to chatGPT the name of our beer styles, and asked it if it could give us 
            a range for the SRM and IBU. It gave us a table with ranges for both values and each beer style. We asked it to compute 
            the mean of the range it gave us to get a single value. At the end, we have tables with estimated values for SRM and IBU.

            As before, for each characteristics we can split our data into two parts:
            <ul>
                <li>Pale beers vs Dark beers</li>
                <li>Mild beers vs Bitter beers</li>
            </ul> 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph-1">
        <p>
            We also need to see the distribution to choose how to split our data. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="plot-container-row" style="margin: 0 15%;">

    <div class="paragraph-1">
        <p>
            Ok so based on these distributions, we will choose as follows:
    
            <ul>
                <li>Pale Beers: SRM &lt;= 10</li>
                <li>Dark Beers: SRM &gt;= 25</li>
                <li>Mild Beers: IBU &lt; 30</li>

            Very interesting! If we merge all our information, we can say that during the summer,
            the most rated (and possibly consumed) beers are light, pale, and mild, while during the winter,
            the preferred beers are strong, dark and bitter.<br><br>

            However, if we think about it a minute, and imagine
            again the beer menu. Aren’t the pale beers often lighter than dark ones? Aren’t strong beers generally
            more bitter than light ones?

        <p>
            For each beer style, we calculate the seasonality metrics, defined by:<br>
            $$\frac{std(\text{seasonality}) - std(\text{residuals})}{\text{normalized number of ratings}}$$

            We end up we a list of beer styles that are the most seasonal for the winter or for the summer.
            The results are quite coherent with our prior analysis.
            We can see the <strong>OkotoberFest</strong> is the most seasonal beer of summer and the <strong>Imperial Pils / Strong Pale Ale</strong> the most seasonal beer style of winter.
        </p>

        <p>
            We can clearly see a distinction in the abv of the summer oriented beers compared with the winter oriented beers style.
            For the winter beer style, the average abv is around <strong>7.4%</strong> whereas the for the summer beer style it is around <strong>5.5%</strong>.

        <p> Bla bla hemisphère nord et sud c'est tout inversé
        Se dire que dans notre analyse, on a fait sur le monde entier, dont plus de 95% sont hémisphères nord. Mais vu que les saisons sont inversées dans l'hémisphère sud, on split en 3 régions. On choisit notamment Océanie pour hémisphère sud car c’est là où il y’a le plus de ratings (y’en a pas bcp en amérique du sud ou en afrique subsaharienne) 

        On prend les 2 beer styles qu’on a identifié comme les plus saisonnaux en été et hiver dans la partie juste avant, et on étudie leur saisonnalité pour nos 3 régions:
