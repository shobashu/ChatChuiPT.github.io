        <p>
            Imagine being on vacation near the beach with a group of friends, savoring the moment as the sun appears to dive into the sea during the beautiful sunset. 
            In your hand, you hold a beer to accompany this serene scene. What kind of beer is it? There is a high chance 
            that your answer is: ‘a light blonde refreshing beer obviously!’. Summer makes us crave a lighter blond beer,  
            while winter is a season for brown beers, high on alcohol to warm us up. 
            But … is everyone thinking like you do ? What do people all over the world think ?  Is it a stereotype? 
            Is this idea verifiable via statistics? That is what we want to explore in our analysis.<br>
            
            Many websites exist where people can give their opinion on the beer they tasted : 
            RateBeer and BeerAdvocate are two of the main popular ones. 
            Analyzing the evolution of parameters such as the given grade or the number of ratings could offer 
            valuable insights into the seasonal trends of various beer styles. 
            Which website should be considered? Let’s examine the country distribution of the two websites:

    </div>

    <div class="intro-end">
        <p>
            As displayed by the map, BeerAdvocate seems to be very popular in the US, while the distribution of the number of ratings 
            in the countries in RateBeer is wider. Therefore, RateBeer data are more representative of the worldwide beer tastes and will 
            be the only data used to try to identify seasonal trends.

    <div class="paragraph-1">
        <h2 class="paragraph-1-title">Which characteristics display seasonal trends?</h2>
        <p>
            RateBeer dataset offers insights on the beer ratings of the website between 2000 and 2016. Data from 01-01-2003 to 01-01-2017 will be considered, due to a lack of ratings before.
            Among the most rated beer styles on RateBeer, 
            we retrieve 3 beer styles that catches our attention and might be interesting to explore:
            <ul>
                <li>IPA: the most rated beer style on the website</li>
                <li>Pilsener: among the 20 most rated beer styles, known to be fresh blond light beers</li>
                <li>Belgian Strong Ale: among the 20 most rated beer styles, known to be dark strong beers</li>
            </ul> 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph-1">
        <p>
            These are the 3 main characters: 'The Famous, the Cool, and the Strong'! Considering them, one would particularly 
            anticipate observing summer trends for Pilsener and winter trends for Belgian Strong Ale.
            What could show that these beer styles are seasonal or not? 

            The RateBeer dataset notably provides the ratings given by the users. The user provides an overall grade 
            for the tasted beer, but also a grade for the aroma, palate, taste, appearance of the beer, and the mean of 
            all these grades gives the rating. These 6 characteristics can be grouped together and considered as <strong>‘user specific’.</strong> 
            It can be supposed that a beer receives different ratings depending on when it is consumed in winter or summer: 
            <br>

                Trends from the evolution of criteria over time are not evident to see for any of the three beer styles. 
                A good idea would be to focus on one characteristic of one beer style: overall score of IPAs, and to use STL 
                (Seasonal-Trend decomposition using LOESS) 
                statistical model. The latter is useful to decompose the plot in 3 subplots: the  <strong>general trend</strong>, the <strong>seasonal</strong>
                and the <strong>residuals</strong>, therefore, potentially revealing seasonal patterns.

    <div class="paragraph-1">
        <p>
            Unfortunately, the residuals show the same amplitude as the ‘seasonal’ part of the plots. 
            For each of the characteristics and each of the beer styles, the same idea was applied: no patterns were discernable. 
            Well, the users do not feel a 
            beer differently depending on the season. Should we give up? Not yet.<br><br><br>

            <strong>Normalised number of ratings</strong>
            <br><br>
            Indeed, it could be supposed that Pilsener gets more ratings during the summer and Belgian Strong Ale during the winter. Assuming that people rate during the same period when they drink the beer, variations in the number of ratings could be representative of variations in beer consumption. 
            In order not to be influenced by the global evolution of ratings on the website, let’s consider the <strong>normalized number of ratings</strong> for these 3 beer styles (Note: for the following plots, only the evolution from 01-01-2010 to 01-01-2017 was displayed, as it was easier to visualize.):

    <div class="paragraph-1">
        <p>
            Remarkably clear trends emerge! Based on the inference that number of ratings mirror consumption, Pilseners 
            appear to be more consumed during the summer, while Belgian Strong Ales are favored during the winter! Interestingly, 
            a recurring trend with IPAs is observed, although it's not as pronounced as with the other two styles. From February to 
            August (roughly spring and summer), there's a rise in consumption, followed by a dip between September and January (autumn and winter). This pattern suggests that even if a beer style isn't expected to be seasonal, its popularity might still be influenced by the time of year.
            But why? What makes Pilseners good beers for the summer? Why do people gradually neglect IPAs from autumn onwards, 
            until spring returns?

            One might consider exploring the reasons behind these specific seasonal patterns.

            Pilsener, with clear trends in summer are the lighter beers, while Belgian Strong Ale, showing peaks in winter, are stronger. IPA’s alcohol degrees are in the middle, consistent with the more spread and less brutal trend.

            Are lighter beers more commonly consumed in the summer, while stronger beers are preferred in winter?
            Let’s split the whole dataset into two categories: light beers and strong beers, and see if the number of ratings is periodic and thus depends on the season. 
            But wait. What is considered as a light or strong beer ? Focusing on the distribution of alcohol degree for all beers:

                <li>Light beers: all the beers whose ABV is strictly inferior to 5</li>
                <li>Strong beers: all the beers whose ABV is superior to 8</li>

            As expected, there is a clear tendency for light beers during the summer and strong beers during the winter. Moreover, the difference of normalized number of ratings is statistically significant !
            <br><br>
            However, is alcohol content the only determinant of beer choice during a season? Picture this: it's December, and cold outside. You step into a bar to order a beer. Tired from the semester, seeking the perfect brew for comfort. 

            The alcohol degree is probably not the only thing that will influence the choice of beer. For example, a preference might lean towards a brown, dark beer rather than a pale one! Alternatively, a preference might be for a bitter beer over a sweet, mild one!
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph-1">
        <h3 class="paragraph-small-title">Color (SRM) and Bitterness (IBU)</h3>
        <p>
            Well, let’s see if beers with different colors or bitterness are drunk at different seasons: <br>
            - The most common value used (in the US at least) to measure beer’s color is the Standard Reference Method,
            or SRM scale for short. Globally, a low SRM value corresponds to a pale beer, while a high SRM value corresponds
            to dark beers.<br>
            - To measure bitterness, the International Bitterness Unit (IBU) is widely accepted as the standard. Mild beers typically 
            have a low IBU, while, conversely, bitter beers tend to have a higher IBU.<br><br>

            Unfortunately, it was too difficult to categorize these characteristics due to the different names used for each site.

            Therefore, an alternative method was chosen: The beer styles were provided to chatGPT, and it was asked to provide a range for the SRM and IBU. A table with ranges for both values and each beer style was given and the mean of the range was computed to obtain a single value. In the end, tables with estimated values for SRM and IBU were obtained.

            As before, for each characteristics we can split our data into two parts:
            <ul>
                <li>Pale beers vs Dark beers</li>
                <li>Mild beers vs Bitter beers</li>
            </ul> 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph-1">
        <p>
            To determine what qualifies as a pale, dark, mild, or bitter beer, it's imperative to examine the distribution of the data and make decisions on how to split the data accordingly :

            Very interesting! Combining all the informations, it can be concluded that during the summer, the most rated (and possibly consumed) beers tend to be light, pale, and mild, whereas during the winter, the preference shifts towards strong, dark, and bitter beers. 
            
            However, reviewing the beer menu in the bar, one might notice that maybe pale beers are often lighter than dark ones. Similarly, strong beers tend to be more bitter compared to lighter ones. Is there any correlation between these factors that could explain the similarity in their tendencies?

        <h2 class="paragraph-1-title">Is their a correlation between ABV, SRM and IBU?</h2>
        <p>
            Statistically, the 3 characteristics ABV, SRM, and IBU could simply be correlated. Computing the Pearson's correlation coefficient and displaying the scatter plots between these characteristics could be relevant:

    <div class="paragraph-1">
        <p>
            Indeed, there is a moderate correlation between these 3 factors. Light beers are more likely to be pale and mild, 
            while dark beers have more chance to be dark and bitter. We see that bitterness and alcohol degree are the most 
            correlated characteristics. <br><br>
            In this analysis, the exploration delved into the seasonality of various beer styles and the reasons behind these periodic trends. We're thirsty now!

        <h2 class="paragraph-1-title">Can we estimate a seasonality metrics per beer style ?</h2>
        <p>
            Now, the goal is to determine which style is the most seasonal, meaning which beer style is truly specific to a season.
            To achieve this, a seasonality degree was computed to quantify the seasonality of each beer style for winter and summer.
            This degree is first calculated for each chosen year, and the mean for every year provides the overall seasonality degree.
            The more likely a beer style is consumed during summer, the higher its seasonality degree will be along the positive y-axis.
            The more likely a beer style is consumed during winter, the higher its seasonality degree will be along the negative y-axis.
            The seasonality metrics is defined by:<br>
            $$100\cdot\frac{std(\text{seasonality}) - std(\text{residuals})}{\text{normalized number of ratings}}\cdot \text{peak month}\{^{-1 \text{ if winter, } +1 \text{ if summer}}_{\text{otherwise 0}}$$
            <br><br>
            The resulting ranking is as follows:

            The analysis yields a curated list of beer styles that shows the seasonal preferences,
            distinguishing between winter and summer favorites. This insightful data aligns well with previous findings. 
            Notably, the <strong>English Strong Ale</strong> emerges as THE summer seasonal beer, while 
            the <strong>Old Ale</strong> stands out 
            as THE premier winter selection.

            When looking at the box plot above, a clear distinction can be seen in the standardized ABV of the summer oriented beers 
            compared with the winter oriented ones.
            A winter beer style will tend to a higher ABV than a summer beer style.<br><br>
            The end?
            Mmh...
            Wait a minute… Since the beginning, the analysis was only conducted considering the time factor. What about geography ?

        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph-1">
        <h2 class="paragraph-1-title">Is there an influence on the location in the seasonality ?</h2>
        <p>
            Indeed, in the analysis, the entire world was considered, even though raters do not come from the same country. However, seasons are not 
            experienced uniformly in every country, especially considering the reversal of seasons in the southern hemisphere compared to the northern 
            hemisphere. Nevertheless, nice trends were obtained for certain beer styles. How is this possible? As shown in the RateBeer rating map at the beginning, about 40% of the ratings are 
            from the US, 
            and above all, northern hemisphere countries represent more than 95% of the data. This explains the observed trends corresponding to a June 
            to August summer and a December to February winter.<br><br>
            
            It would still be interesting to see if the seasonal trends are indeed reversed for the southern hemisphere.
            Thus, 3 regions are selected: North America (USA, Canada), Europe (33 countries) and Oceania (Australia, New Zealand).
            The choice of Oceania is because they are the only southern hemisphere countries with a relevant number of ratings. 

            Let's explore this question for a beer style that was identified as being suited for summer
            (according to the degree of seasonality degree metric): <strong>Pale Lager</strong>. 
        </p>


        <div class="plot-container">
            <h3 class="plot-title">Pale Lager seasonality plot from the STL applied to its normalized number of ratings for the 3 regions</h3>

                <iframe src="html_files/pale_lager.html" width="100%"></iframe>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
            The plot above shows that the <strong>Europe</strong> and <strong>North America</strong> number of ratings tends to reach their peaks in the summer, as expected.
            However, when looking at the <strong>Oceania</strong> plot, the number of ratings tends to reach their peaks shifted by 6 months later than in the northern hemisphere.
        </p>

        <p>
            This gives us more confidence about the hypothesis that the <strong>Pale Lager</strong> is more often consummed during summer, independently of the location.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, this result also shows that taking into account the location of the rating when analyzing could lead to less biased conclusions.
            On the other hand, comparing the normalized number of ratings from the southern hemisphere to the northern hemisphere shows that the effect is really negligeable.
            <br><br>
            Moreover, in the case of the <strong>Pale Lager</strong>, there are 25 times less ratings in Oceania compared to Europe and North America. It explains, why the Oceania's seasonal patterns are noisier than the other continents.

        <h2 class="paragraph-1-title"> Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Finally, what can we say? We were thirsty, and the last part of this story made us want to take a trip halfway 
            around the world! This analysis aimed at investigating whether the stereotype ‘light blonde beer = summer’ and ‘dark
            brown beer = winter’ was quantifiable by significant statistics. The normalized number of ratings showed periodic evolution 
            for certain beer styles, supposing that beer consumption also depends on seasons. Three possible reasons to explain these 
            patterns could be some of the main characteristics of beer: alcohol degree (ABV), color (SRM) and bitterness (IBU) which 
            furthermore are relatively correlated.
            
            Lastly, the computed seasonality degree allowed us to obtain the most seasonal beers and preceded the quick exploration 
            of seasonal trends in different hemispheres.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, this study is far from having investigated all the parameters that encircle the question of seasonal beer 
            trends. For example, other beer characteristics such as original/final gravity, volumes of CO2 (quantifiable values), or 
            clarity, malt ingredients (non quantifiable) could be good options to deepen the analysis.  It would also have been relevant 
            to see if some breweries are more or less specialized in the creation of seasonal beers, if they favor a particular season, or 
            even generate most of their sales during a given period.
