            Winter is a season for brown beers, high on alcohol to warm us up,
            while summer makes us crave a lighter blond beer. But do we really
            observe trends based on seasons? In fact, each individual may tend
            to consume different beers based on its mood or feeling influenced
            by the season. A study of a high variety of beer styles may help to
            see if some beers have variable success rate accross the year or 
            inversely have a constant consumption rate. After identifying the seasonal tendencies,
            we will observe if those tendencies varies accross the year, i.e.
            is the beer success ephemere or anchored in the consumption habits of
            beer drinkers? Seeing this seasonal variability, we will investigate the
            comment's enthusiasm for a beer accross season and see if this correlates
            with the seasonal cyles observed. Finally, we will see how the beweries take
            advantage of those cyclic consumption rates in their beer proposal.
