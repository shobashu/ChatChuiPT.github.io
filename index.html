    <div class="introduction">
        <p>
            Imagine being on vacation, near the beach, with a group of friends enjoying the sun diving into the sea. 
            In your hand, you hold a beer to accompany this sunset. What kind of beer is it? There is a high chance 
            that your answer is: ‘a light blonde refreshing beer obviously!’. Summer makes us crave a lighter blond beer,  
            while winter is a season for brown beers, high on alcohol to warm us up. 
            But … is everyone thinking like you do ? What do people all over the world think ?  Is it a stereotype? 
            Is this idea verifiable via statistics? That is what we want to explore in our analysis.<br>
            
            Many websites exist where people can give their opinion on the beer they tasted : 
            RateBeer and BeerAdvocate are two of the main popular ones. 
            Analyzing the evolution of parameters such as the given grade or the number of ratings could offer 
            valuable insights into the seasonal trends of various beer styles. 
            Which website should be considered? Let’s examine the country distribution of the two websites:

    </div>

    <div class="intro-end">
        <p>
            As displayed by the map, BeerAdvocate seems to be very popular in the US, while the distribution of the number of ratings in the countries in RateBeer is wider. Therefore, RateBeer data are more representative of the worldwide beer tastes and will be the only data used to try to identify seasonal trends. Data from 01-01-2003 to 01-01-2017 are considered.
        </p>

    <div class="paragraph-1">
        <h2 class="paragraph-1-title">Which characteristics display seasonal trends?</h2>
        <p>
            RateBeer dataset offers insights on the beer ratings of the website between 2000 and 2016.
            Among the most rated beer styles on RateBeer, 
            we retrieve 3 beer styles that catches our attention and might be interesting to explore:
            <ul>
                <li>IPA: the most rated beer style on the website</li>
                <li>Pilsener: among the 20 most rated beer styles, known to be fresh blond light beers</li>
                <li>Belgian Strong Ale: among the 20 most rated beer styles, known to be dark strong beers</li>
            </ul> 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph-1">
        <p>
            Considering these three characters: 'The Famous, the Cool, and the Strong,' one would particularly 
            anticipate observing summer trends for Pilsener and winter trends for Belgian Strong Ale.
            What could show that these beer styles are seasonal or not? 

            The RateBeer dataset notably provides the ratings given by the users. The user provides an overall grade 
            for the tasted beer, but also a grade for the aroma, palate, taste, appearance of the beer, and the mean of 
            all these grades gives the rating. These 6 characteristics can be grouped together and considered as ‘user specific’. 
            It can be supposed that a beer receives different ratings depending on when it is consumed—whether in winter or summer.:

            Unfortunately, the residuals show the same amplitude as the ‘seasonal’ part of the plots, for each of the characteristics and each of the beer styles. Well, the users do not feel a beer differently depending on the season. Should we give up? Not yet.<br><br><br>

            <strong>Normalised number of ratings</strong>
            <br><br>
            Indeed, it could be supposed that Pilsener gets more ratings during the summer and Belgian Strong Ale during the winter. Assuming that people rate during the same period when they drink the beer, variation in the number of ratings could be representative of variation in beer consumption. 
            In order not to be influenced by the global evolution of ratings on the website, let’s consider the normalized number of ratings for these 3 beer styles (Note: for the following plots, we only display the evolution from 01-01-2010 to 01-01-2017, as it is easier to visualize.):

        <p>
            Remarkably clear trends emerge! Based on the inference that ratings mirror consumption, Pilsener appears to be more consumed during the summer, while Belgian Strong Ale is favored during the winter! Interestingly, a recurring trend with IPAs is observed, although it's not as pronounced as with the other two styles. From February to August (roughly spring and summer), there's a rise in consumption, followed by a dip between September and January (autumn and winter). This pattern suggests that even if a beer style isn't expected to be seasonal, its popularity might still be influenced by the time of year.
            But why? What makes Pilsener a good beer for the summer? Why do people gradually turn away from IPA from autumn onwards, until spring returns?

            One might consider exploring the reasons behind these specific seasonal patterns.

            Pilsener, with clear trends in summer are the lighter beers, while Belgian Strong Ale, showing peaks in winter, are stronger. IPA’s alcohol degrees are in the middle, consistent with the more spread and less brutal trend.

            Are lighter beers more commonly consumed in the summer, while stronger beers are preferred in winter?
            Let’s split the whole dataset into two categories: light beers and strong beers, and see if the number of ratings is periodic and thus depends on the season. 
            But wait. What is considered as a light or strong beer ? Let’s focus on the distribution of alcohol degree among beers chosen:

            As expected, there is a clear tendency for light beers during the summer and strong beers during the winter. Moreover, the difference of normalized number of ratings is statistically significant !

            However, is alcohol content the only determinant of beer choice during a season? Picture this: it's December, and cold outside. We step into a bar to order a beer. Tired from the semester, seeking the perfect brew for comfort. 

            The alcohol degree is probably not the only thing that will influence the choice of beer. For example, a preference might lean towards a brown, dark beer rather than a pale one! Alternatively, a preference might be for a bitter beer over a sweet, mild one!
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph-1">
        <h3 class="paragraph-small-title">Color (SRM) and Bitterness (IBU)</h3>
        <p>
            Well, let’s see if beers with different colors or bitterness are drunk at different seasons: <br>
            - The most common value used (in the US at least) to measure beer’s color is the Standard Reference Method,
            or SRM scale for short. Globally, a low SRM value corresponds to a pale beer, while a high SRM value corresponds
            to dark beers.<br>
            - To measure bitterness, the International Bitterness Unit (IBU) is widely accepted as the standard. Mild beers typically 
            have a low IBU, while, conversely, bitter beers tend to have a higher IBU.<br><br>

            Unfortunately, it was too difficult to categorize these characteristics due to the different names used for each site.

            Therefore, an alternative method was chosen: The beer styles were provided to chatGPT, and it was asked to provide a range for the SRM and IBU. A table with ranges for both values and each beer style was given and the mean of the range was computed to obtain a single value. In the end, tables with estimated values for SRM and IBU were obtained.

            As before, for each characteristics we can split our data into two parts:
            <ul>
                <li>Pale beers vs Dark beers</li>
                <li>Mild beers vs Bitter beers</li>
            </ul> 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph-1">
        <p>
            To determine what qualifies as a pale, dark, mild, or bitter beer, it's imperative to examine the distribution of the data and make decisions on how to split the data accordingly :

            Very interesting! Combining all the information, it can be concluded that during the summer, the most rated (and possibly consumed) beers tend to be light, pale, and mild, whereas during the winter, the preference shifts towards strong, dark, and bitter beers. 
            
            However, reviewing the beer list, one might notice that maybe pale beers are often lighter than dark ones. Similarly, strong beers tend to be more bitter compared to lighter ones. Is there any correlation between these factors that could explain the similarity in their tendencies?

            Indeed, there is a moderate correlation between these 3 factors. Light beers are more likely to be pale and mild, while dark beers have more chance to be dark and bitter. We see that bitterness and alcohol degree are the most correlated characteristics. 
            In this analysis, the exploration delved into the seasonality of various beer styles and the reasons behind these periodic trends. We're thirsty now!

        <h2 class="paragraph-1-title">Can we estimate a seasonality metrics per beer style ?</h2>
        <p>
            For each beer style, we calculate the seasonality metrics, defined by:<br>
            $$100\frac{std(\text{seasonality}) - std(\text{residuals})}{\text{normalized number of ratings}}\cdot \text{peak month}_{-1 \text{ if winter, } +1 \text{ if summer}}^{0 \text{ otherwise}}$$
            Now, the goal is to determine which style is the most seasonal, meaning which beer style is truly specific to a season. To achieve this, a seasonality degree was computed to quantify the seasonality of each beer style for winter and summer. This degree is first calculated for each chosen year, and the mean for every year provides the overall seasonality degree. The more likely a beer style is consumed during summer, the higher its seasonality degree will be along the positive y-axis.  The more likely a beer style is consumed during winter, the higher its seasonality degree will be along the negative y-axis. The resulting ranking is as follows:

        <p>
            We end up we a list of beer styles that are the most seasonal for the winter or for the summer.
            The results are quite coherent with our prior analysis.
            We can see that the <strong>English Strong Ale</strong> is the most seasonal beer of summer and the <strong>Old Ale</strong> the most seasonal beer style of winter.
        </p>

        <p>
            When looking at the box plot above, we can clearly see a distinction in the standardized ABV of the summer oriented beers compared with the winter oriented beers style.
            A winter beer style will tend to a higher ABV than a summer beer style.

        <h2 class="paragraph-1-title">Is there an influence on the location in the seasonality ?</h2>
        <p>
            For obvious reasons, the southern hemisphere will have seasons shifted by 6 months relatively to the northern hemisphere. Throughout all the prior analysis, we omitted the effect of the location on the rating itself.
            In this part, we will focus on one beer that is more suited for summer: <strong>Pale Lager</strong>. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In the plot below, we can see the <strong>Europe</strong> and <strong>North America</strong> ratings tends to reach their highest number in summer, as expected.
            However, when looking at the <strong>Oceania</strong> plot, we see that the ratings tends to reach their highest number shifted by 6 months.
        </p>

        <p>
            This gives us more confidence about the hypothesis that the <strong>Pale Lager</strong> is more often consummed during hot seasons (summer in northern europe) than cold seasons.

        <p>
            This result however also shows that we should have taken into the location of the rating when analyzing it.
            However, when comparing the proportion of ratings from the southern hemisphere to the northern hemisphere, we realized the effect was really negligeable (in the case of the <strong>Pale Lager</strong>, there are 25 times less ratings from Oceania than from Europe and North America)

        <h2 class="paragraph-1-title"> Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Finally, what can we say? We were thirsty, and the last part of this story made us want to take a trip halfway around the world! We wanted to further investigate whether the stereotype ‘light blonde beer = summer’ and ‘dark brown beer = winter’ was quantifiable by significant statistics. The number of ratings showed periodic evolution for certain beer styles, supposing that beer consumption also depends on seasons. Three possible reasons to explain these patterns could be some of the main characteristics of beer: alcohol degree (ABV), color (SRM) and bitterness (IBU) which furthermore are relatively correlated.
            
            Lastly, the computed seasonality degree allowed us to obtain the most seasonal beers and preceded the quick exploration of seasonal trends in different hemispheres.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, this study is far from having investigated all the parameters that encircle the question of seasonal beer trends. For example, other beer characteristics such as original/final gravity, volumes of CO2 (quantifiable values), or clarity, malt ingredients (non quantifiable) could be good options to deepen the analysis.  It would also have been relevant to see if some breweries are more or less specialized in the creation of seasonal beers, if they favor a particular season, if they generate most of their sales during a given period and many more.
